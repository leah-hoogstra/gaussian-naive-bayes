# gaussian-naive-bayes
Final project for DATA 2060 Fall 2024: Machine Learning: from Theory to Practice. We implement a Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm and compare our implementation to scikitlearn's version of the algorithm on the UCI wine dataset. 

A copy of the .yml file used for the course is provided here.
